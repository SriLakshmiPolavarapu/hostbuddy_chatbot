PayPal + Groq AI Integration

This project demonstrates a cloud-hosted Python application that integrates PayPal Sandbox for test payments and Groq AI for LLM-powered chat, all running in Replit.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Open the Replit Project
Go to your Replit dashboard and open the Python Repl containing main.py.

2. Add Secrets (API Keys)
Click the Secrets (lock icon) in the left sidebar and add the following:

PAYPAL_USER → Your PayPal sandbox API username

PAYPAL_PWD → Your PayPal sandbox API password

PAYPAL_SIGNATURE → Your PayPal sandbox API signature

GROQ_API_KEY → Your Groq API key

Storing secrets this way keeps your credentials safe and out of the code.

3. Check the Code
Make sure main.py is present and using os.getenv() to access the secrets.

4. Run the Project
Click the green “Run” button at the top of Replit, or open the Shell and type:

python3 main.py


5. Check Console Output
You should see something like:

ACK=Success
TOKEN=EC-XXXXXXX
Redirect user to:
https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=EC-XXXXXXX


6. Test PayPal Payment
Copy the redirect URL from the console and open it in a browser.
Log in using your sandbox buyer account to simulate a payment.
Note: No real money is used — it’s all in sandbox mode.

7. Test Groq AI Chat
Enter a prompt in the AI section of the program. The app sends it to Groq API and returns a real-time response.

8. End-to-End Verification
Confirm that both:

PayPal sandbox flow works (ACK=Success + checkout page), and

Groq AI responds correctly to prompts.
